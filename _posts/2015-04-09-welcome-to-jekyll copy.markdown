A concept from the Marketing Department at Te Papa New Zealand has emerged, showing an “x marks the spot” for where viewers of artworks can take a selfie. As Jim and Mary Barr both state on Over the Net:

> “One minute you think it’s going to take the job of showing our art culture seriously [*Te Papa*] and then, before you know it, it’s making an out-of-left-field panicky effort to not fall behind in the audience attention arms race."

Come on Te Papa, pull your socks up.



Sincerely,
