> Seems like more and more people are constantly on their smartphones nowadays.

It is now considered the norm for a group of friends to be sat in a circle, but rather than talk to each other face-to-face they are looking at their phones. Or families that spend entire evenings together but are on their phones. 

From a personal viewpoint, it seems as though people are content with putting an electronic device between their friends and family. The “Internet of Things” and the attitudes of todays society means that this is becoming more and more common.

But what is the effect of all this? Does checking your Facebook and Twitter feeds when you are sitting next to your best friend make you closer to them? What will your friend think of you doing this? That you find your phone more interesting than talking to you.

There’s the argument that people of today need to be checking their phones constantly, whether it’s for their work or to keep in touch with friends and family. But at what point is it too much? 

Would people prefer all communication and social interactions be done electronically? All social events, concerts, birthdays etc recorded on smartphones rather than being truly experienced by the respective person - do people really want such a thing?

For all the conveniences that smartphones possess, is it worth these sacrifices? On the surface, the idea of checking your phone every now and again seems completely harmless, and that itself is true. However, if you do this for long enough you are allowing your phone to become ingrained in your day-to-day life.

Do people really need a source of distraction at any given moment?
