The [I.O.W.A. collective][iowa] has had many changes since growing independent from the Elam sculpture project.

The main noticeable change is the lack of leadership/definite direction (which is arguably not a bad thing in a collective). Last year when the collective operated under the Elam sculpture module, I.O.W.A. loosely operated under the instructions of Michael Parekowhai and Rik Wilson, who had overseen the project and acted as mentors.

This meant that we had a clearer sense of direction: we all had the same deadlines and carried out these loose instructions given to us by our tutors. However, this did not mean they acted as our leaders; in the end we held the power to do what we want and how to do it, and they acted as advisors. This way I.O.W.A. was able to act with no social hierarchies and people had their specific roles/skills for contribution.

Fast-forward to 2015, and the collective continued to operate independently from Elam and it's staff. From November 2014 we have been working on our [upcoming exhibition][up] at Studio One Toi Tu, Ponsonby (formely known as Artstation), which is scheduled for July 29. All of the work that we have been making has been in relation to our upcoming show. So far, the two most resolved works created during this time is [_Workforce_][wf] and [_The Basketball Project_][bb].

The main difficulties of this year include the resignation of one member, as well as organising meetings/times for creating work. Everyone in the collective have their own obligations which often clash with one-another. Migrating from first to second year has resulted a greater workload at Elam and a greater emphasis on time management, meaning everyone collectively has less free time. Being a conjoint student, I have had to organise myself even more in order to try and stay on top of everything.

However, there have been many positive things happen to the I.O.W.A. collective in 2015. We welcomed three new members, making us 15 strong, and were invited to give a morning lecture to the Elam first year students and staff on our experiences as a collective. And we have been continuing to create work as I.O.W.A. despite the extra workload.

Sincerely,
