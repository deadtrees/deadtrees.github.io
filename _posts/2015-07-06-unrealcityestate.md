_What is it like to live in an imaginary city?_

Over the past two weeks I've been involved in a project known as [Unreal City Estate][un], created by [Jun Kitazawa][jun] and curated by Sara Black. This was a satellite project which was a part of the [2015 International Award for Public Art conference][iapa] (IAPA 2015), hosted by the University of Auckland, the Elam School of Fine Arts, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki and the Shandong University of Art & Design.

The Unreal City Estate in Albert Park, Auckland was a place _“where people get together and create ‘an imaginary city’ that could exist alongside the real city we live in today.”_ Anyone is able to lease out there own plot of land on Albert Park and respond to their chosen site how they wish. It is essentially a city within a city, placed in the public context of a park between 11 AM and 3 PM on Sunday 5th July.

Kitazawa's practice primarily involves working with small communities and the idea of the small festival, following studies by scholars such as [Yanagita Kunio][yk] and others. All across Japan small towns celebrate festivals that are undertaken by members of the community, for the community. Therefore, these festivals are events that are for themselves, not necessarily an event for others. However, through the recent spike in popular art festivals and larger festivals in general, it has meant that these smaller village/town festivals are dying out.

Japan, like many other countries, is currently undergoing a climate of change. While people traditionally lived in smaller communities, this way of living is slowly dying out as people move to more urban areas in looking for work and other reasons. The result of this being the slow death of these rural towns and everything along with it. My own personal experience of this being my grandmother's town of [Kikonai][kikonai], Hokkaido (木古内町 _Kikonai-chō_), which was once a relatively active and thriving town of around 12,000 people, but now has a total population of approximately 4800 as of 2015. The total population has been reduced to less than half of what it once was in the space of roughly 50 years.

Kitazawa's projects are spread across various small towns in Japan. Each project takes years of preparation and organisation, through public funding grants, close collaboration with other artists and members of the respective communities. Once started, the community could then essentially take ownership of the project and decide whether or not they wished for it to continue. He believes that if Japan’s traditional cultural belief which has existed since antiquity, held by the people who sustained these smaller festivals are lost today, it is our duty (or the artist's duty) to recreate them.

Over time Kitazawa wanted the community to truly build and take over these projects from the very beginning. Projects that are marked in blue are examples of people who have assembled on their own accord, with no prior advertisement and/or information regarding the project. Through people taking up the projects on their own initiative, some projects such as Kitazawa's [_Living Room_][lr] project have sprung up all over Japan.

While previous projects have had years and years of preparation, Unreal City Estate has taken one month to prepare. This makes the project unique in comparison with previous undertakings, the majority of which have been based in Japan and have had a longer time-frame. This project is of a much smaller scale than previous projects, with the imaginary city being limited within the space of Albert Park.

### THE IOWA COLLECTIVE AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT

This project was the perfect opportunity for [IOWA][iowa] to respond in some way. Kitazawa's practice somewhat parallels to that of IOWA, in that there are no social hierarchies and anyone and everyone is able to participate. Through negotiation with everyone involved in the project, IOWA decided on leasing three spaces in Albert Park and choose activities for each. These activities were:

- A "bubblebath" space
- A hairdressing space
- A [koha][koha] space

On the day of the project 7 members of IOWA, including myself, responded to each site and attempted to make something out of this alternative daily life. From the onset our planning was sparse and we were unable to fathom how the project would turn out. Given that it was a Sunday morning during winter, with the weather looking precarious at times, we were also uncertain in regards to how many people would arrive.

_The Bubblebath space_

To initiate the bubblebath space, approximately 20 balloons were blown up and placed in the Albert Park fountain. These balloons acted as a “bubbles”, and each contained a small amount of water to weigh it down and prevent them from flying away. This amount was then increased to approximately 60 balloons. Actual bottles of bubble soap with wands were also placed around the space, open for people to use and take home with them if they wished.

_The Hairdressing space_

The hairdressing space, also known as the “Unicorn Horn space” was undertaken by IOWA member Joseph Durana. People could come and receive haircuts, free of charge. Across the course of the day 2 people had their hair cut, both of whom were connected to the project. Nevertheless, the sight of someone getting their hair cut in a public space created an interesting and unusual spectacle for people, this being an underlying motif in all of Kitazawa's projects.

A koha space was set up near one of the main entrances into Albert Park. This space contained many relics, strange objects and materials which people left behind or could take home for free. None of the activities for the Unreal City involved money and were done out of the good will of various people. Because of this, the project as a whole could be perceived as an act of koha, since people are giving up their own time and energy for the sake of others.

Things were initially slow to get going across the whole park. Windy weather conditions meant that the balloons were having to be constantly re-installed as they would be blown out of the fountain space. It also meant that any members of the public who passed through the park would not sit and relax, as the constant winds prevented them from doing so.

_Children interacting with the work_
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
However, from about 2 PM the weather conditions began to calm down, and more people began interacting with the bubblebath space. It is important to note that children were the first to react to the space, with the adults reluctantly following them. Kitazawa explained that in previous projects children were always the first to take initiative and react with what was happening, perhaps because of their directness and brutal honesty.

More and more people began to engage with the space, to the point where we were no longer needed to keep the space alive. We were then able to successfully fulfill one of the goals of this project; creating something for the community which they can take ownership of and use for themselves. Even after 3 PM people were still engaging with the space despite our absence. While the hairdressers and koha space had been cleaned up, the bubblebath continued to attract members of the public.

Ultimately, the simplicity, ambiguity and initiative of the children are what I believe kept the bubblebath alive for as long as it did. It was fantastic to see what other participants of the Unreal City created and how the public reacted. There were antique stores, cafes, tightrope workshops, time-machines,  queer universities among others, all of which were unique in their own way and related back to this Unreal City as well as Auckland City.  

Thank you everyone who participated in the project, it was a lot of fun to be a part of.
