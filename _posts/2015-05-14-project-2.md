My experience with making collaborative sculpture

At the beginning of this project I was exploring how objects and materials made to be practical and functional could be rendered completely useless through a single gesture. It is as though these objects are undergoing a form of “silent protest”, and in a lot of cases creates a narrative. I went out and took photographs of displaced objects in my neighbourhood, attempting to observe things with a greater sense of criticality and analysis in order to bring out something interesting from this upper-middle class suburb. Traditionally, an artist imposes an order to the material to make it “art”, but in this case I am negotiating with objects and materials in their found state. These series of photographs could be considered as “research in-situ.” 

After that research project I began working in a collaborative environment with Joseph Durana and Louis Betana (and Carmela Nepomuceno as an initial contributor). We gathered displaced objects from all around Central Auckland and brought them into the studio. For the next 1 ½ weeks we arranged these objects in the space, with the concept of materiality vs. materialism in mind (how the value of an object is affected depending on an artist's engagement).

Once we had grown tired of using readymade objects, we made two _jungle gym_ frames in the metal workshop, and attempted to make our work minimal and conceptual. However, in doing so we lost the sense of volatility and process that made our original work exciting, and instead tried to appear as “art.” And so, from the fifth week we began to explore art as a means of play and removed any kind of conceptual thought from the making process. In doing this the space became _the playground._

   I found the collaborative process highly rewarding and enjoyable for the most part. Working in a group allowed for each member to act as a foil to one another and bounce ideas off of each other. It helped each of us from becoming locked into a linear train of thought, which is a potential danger of working individually. Any ideas that would have been difficult to undertake as a group I did as personal research.

This project has also been the first time I have documented to such an extent. During the whole six weeks I took a total of 971 photographs, uploaded approximately 13 gigabytes worth of documentation onto my project site [www.p2.tomhackshaw.com][p2], and created an 174 page shared index containing photographs with dates, credit and any other relevant information. The documentative process became a project in itself and is one of my overall highlights. 

If I had more time I would have liked to have made more work at the metal workshop. While working with found objects was initially exciting and rewarding, the process did become stale and introducing more made objects/structures might possibly prevent this. I would have also liked to have worked with other people in the sculpture group (other than Joseph and Louis), to gain as many different perspectives and ideas as possible.
